## üß© Compound Components & Render Props

- **Modal Component**: Compound pattern for `Modal.Open` and `Modal.Window` enables multiple modals and clean trigger logic.
- **Table.Body**: Uses the render props pattern for custom row rendering, making the table highly reusable and extensible.

## ‚ú® Cabin Management
- **Unified Create/Edit Form**: One form handles both creating and editing, with dynamic validation and pre-filled data.
- **Atomic File Uploads**: Images are uploaded only after a successful DB operation, with rollback on failure.
- **Smart Validation**: Numeric validation (e.g., discount < price) that prevents common user mistakes.
- **Optimistic Mutations**: UI updates before server confirmation for a snappy feel.
- **Custom File Inputs**: Styled file selectors that work seamlessly with form libraries.

## üìã Table & UI Patterns
- **Compound Table API**: `Table.Header`, `Table.Body`, `Table.Row`, and `Table.Footer` for maximum flexibility.
- **Dynamic Columns**: Pass column templates as props for easy layout changes.
- **Render Props**: `Table.Body` accepts a render function for custom row rendering.
- **Styled Components**: All UI is themeable and easily customizable.
